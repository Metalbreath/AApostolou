- Research for the most suitable Chart library
- I 've chose Chartjs.
	*Good looking charts
	*Easy to implement
	*Easy to use
	*It can read external JSON files
	*Very flexible (easy to customize)
	*Free
	*One library is needed  (I was between Flot and Chartjs. Flot will require more library in order to get different designs)
	*Great variaty of people is using it (easy to find solution)
	*You can separate the data that you give in Chartjs by datasets - colors and 
	 options - sizes for better visualization of what you are looking for. I personally find it  better because it keeps the code clean
	
-Starting the html file (upload the libraries - JQuery, Chart.min.js and chartJQ.js)
